# vxpCommonGodot
This is a _small_ collection of tiny scripts and shader that I like to use in my Godot projects to either jump start something new or to test some things.
If you read this and you're beginning to learn Godot ... *DON'T* just use this, learn GDScript, then first try to understand what this code is trying to do and once you got that you can start considering using this.

# Q&A:

## Why is it here?
I don't really know ... I like OpenSource and I'm planning to realease some thing using this anyway so couldn't really hurt to make this public.

## Can I use this?
Sure, I would appreciate credit, but it's not like I could prove that you used this anyways.
